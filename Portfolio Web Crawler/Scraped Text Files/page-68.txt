Click through to purchase a new Callaway Paradym driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



The Paradym driver lineup — which comes in three models to help you find your best fit — incorporates proven technologies that Callaway has refined to blend greater forgiveness with more distance.

Models include the Callaway Paradym, Callaway Paradym X and Callaway Paradym Triple Diamond.

Cobra Aerojet, Aerojet LS and Aerojet Max Drivers
Click through to purchase a new Cobra Aerojet driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



Well, if the name wasn’t already a dead giveaway, a key component of what makes the Aerojet faster is its new aerodynamic shaping which streamlines the front and rear of the club, along with the crown and sole to help the club head move through the air with the least possible resistance. Models include the Cobra Aerojet, Cobra Aerojet LS and Cobra Aerojet Max.

Mizuno ST-Z 230, ST-X 230 and ST-X PLTNM 230 Drivers

                $500-550            
Click through to purchase a new Mizuno ST230 driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



The key piece of technology across Mizuno’s ST230 line is the CORTECH Chamber, which is a high-density stainless-steel weight encased in elastomeric TPU on the sole. The TPU material fills a through slot in the sole behind the face to allow for greater flex and an expanded COR zone. The stainless steel weight serves a secondary purpose, by positioning more mass low and closer to the face to help increase energy transfer, launch, and lower spin, while the TPU Insert also provides acoustic tuning for a powerful impact sound. Models include the Mizuno ST-Z 230, Mizuno ST-X 230 and Mizuno ST-X PLTNM 230.

Ping G430 Max, G430 SFT, G430 LST Drivers

                $600            
Click through to purchase a new Ping G430 driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



Five months after Ping’s G430 took the PGA Tour by storm in Las Vegas, the driver lineup is officially coming to retail. As we’ve come to expect from Ping, all three drivers (G430 LST, G430 SFT and G430 Max) are plenty forgiving and boast a heaping helping of stability. But there’s more to G430 than pure stability. Ping engineers cranked up the speed with the help of a shallower and thinner VFT forged face designed with the same Spinsistency technology the equipment manufacturer first debuted in its fairway woods and hybrids. The complexly curved clubface features a modified roll profile with less loft on the lower portion to normalize spin and increase ball speed. Models include the Ping G430 Max, Ping G430 SFT and Ping G430 LST.

PXG 0311 Gen5 and 0211 drivers

PXG 0311 Gen5, 0311 XF Gen5 and 0211 Drivers

                $300-500            
Click through to purchase a new PXG 0311 or 0211 driver.

        BUY NOW      



The Gen5 drivers comes in two models — the standard 0311 Gen5 with a traditional headshape and a deeper face for a low-spin trajectory and more distance. The other is the 0311 Gen5 XF, which has a larger face for an expanding hitting zone and mid-spin launch for maximum forgiveness. The new 0211 line of clubs continue to offer high-end technology but scales back on everything that many golfers aren’t looking for in the first place. The 0211 driver utilizes a premium 412 titanium face with a variable thickness design to improve ball speed on mishits. Models include the PXG 0311 Gen 5, PXG 0311 Gen5 XF and PXG 0211.

Srixon ZX MK II drivers

Srixon ZX5 MKII and ZX7 MK II Drivers

                $500            
Click through to purchase a new Srixon ZX MK II driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



The power in the ZX MKII woods comes from Srixon’s Rebound Frame which is in its second generation. This frame creates multiple areas in the head for the face and body to seamlessly flex to create better energy transfer to the ball resulting in more ball speed and more distance. The flex zones of the ZX MKII woods work like double-stacked trampolines — not something we recommend you try unless you’re looking to break your collar bone, but something that works great when you’re looking for distance off the tee. Models include the Srixon ZX5 MKII and Srixon ZX7 MKII.

                $600-630            
Click through to purchase a new TaylorMade Stealth 2 driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



The carbon wood is here to stay, and after the Stealth driver cemented its place into the bags of Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler, Tiger Woods and many more elite pros, Stealth 2 brings even more speed, forgiveness and control to players’ bags. The standout feature of the Stealth 2 line is the Nano textured 60X Carbon Twist Face that has a newly optimized profile off the back of the face that incorporates TaylorMade’s famous Inverted Cone Technology (ICT) to better maintain ball speeds on shots hit away from center. Models include the TaylorMade Stealth 2, TaylorMade Stealth 2 HD and TaylorMade Stealth 2 Plus.

Titleist TSR1, TSR2, TSR3 and TSR4 Drivers

                $600-800            
Click through to purchase a new Titleist TSR driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



At roughly 40 grams lighter than a standard driver, Titleist’s 460cc TSR1 driver is exactly what you’re thinking — a lightweight product designed for slower to moderate swing speeds who want to pick up more distance (and launch) without making significant modifications to their swing. The TSR2 has been re-engineered from the inside out to deliver more ball speed, stability and a look that fits more in line with the rest of the TSR series. The TSR3 follows a similar path of the improvements to the TSR2, thanks to a newly designed face insert and a subtly reshaped skirt and sole for better aerodynamics. The TSR4 is a true specialty club in the fitting space designed to offer reduced spin for players that have swing dynamics that make it harder to create ideal launch conditions. The TSR4 also offers a smaller head profile. At 430cc, it’s one of few sub-460cc drivers on the market. Models include the Titleist TSR1, Titleist TSR2, Titleist TSR3 and Titleist TSR4.

Click through to purchase a new Wilson Dynapower driver from Fairway Jockey.

        BUY NOW      



The new Dynapower adjustable drivers are offered in two distinct models: the Carbon and the Titanium to help golfers tune into their ideal shot shape off the tee. Both drivers are equipped with Wilson’s PKR2 dynamic face which has been optimized to deliver fast ball speeds, and a new six-way adjustable hosel to allow fitters and golfers the opportunity to change launch and spin with a few clicks of a wrench. Models include Wilson Dynapower Platinum and Dynapower Titanium.
