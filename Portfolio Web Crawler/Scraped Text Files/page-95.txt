Click through to purchase your new Callaway Paradym irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



The Paradym and Paradym X irons are designed to offer the best combination of feel and distance by pairing Callaway’s Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) face technology with a forged 455 material. Each iron face is uniquely optimized through A.I. based on parameters set by the engineers to deliver more ball speed and higher launch through the set — because you don’t hit your 9-iron and 5-iron the same way. Models include Callaway Paradym and Callaway Paradym X.

Click through to purchase your new Cobra Aerojet or King Tour irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



It’s not often we see a top equipment manufacturer eschew the “pour every bit of technology we have into it” trend and opt for the lesser-seen “make something classic” strategy. But that’s exactly what Cobra did with its all-new King Tour and King Tour CB/MB irons. The new Aerojet iron, designed for players who not only want added forgiveness, but an iron that cranks out additional distance in much the same manner as the Aerojet woods do. Models include Cobra King Tour, Cobra King Tour CB, Cobra King Tour MB and Cobra Aerojet.

Click through to purchase your new Miura irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



In Miura’s eyes, the new KM 700 is more than just another iron in the company’s matrix. It’s the culmination of five years of collaborative work that brought together state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques and specialized grinds to create an iron that’s designed to consistently deliver the head square at impact. The newly reengineered MC-502 brings together the looks and performance of a blade with the playability of a smaller forged cavity-back iron. Models include Miura KM-700 and Miura MC-502.

Mizuno JPX 923 Hot Metal, JPX 923 Hot Metal HL, JPX 923 Hot Metal Pro, JPX 923 Forged and JPX 923 Tour Irons

                $137.50/club            
Click through to purchase your new Mizuno JPX 923 irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



If JPX Hot Metal Pro is the game-improvement model for the more accomplished player, the general assumption is Hot Metal HL (High Launch) is the new super game-improvement option. With a matte grey look, the High Launch features slightly different cosmetics that differentiate it from the standard Hot Metal and Pro. The new Tour and Forged irons round out Mizuno’s JPX923 iron lineup, which offers their most comprehensive fitting program ever. Models include the Mizuno JPX 923 Forged, Mizuno JPX 923 Tour, Mizuno JPX 923 Hot Metal, Mizuno JPX 923 Hot Metal HL and Mizuno JPX 923 Hot Metal Pro.

Ping G430 and i230 irons

Ping G430 and i230 Irons

                $157.25-187.50/club            
Click through to purchase your new Ping G430 or i230 irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



The G430 isn’t your standard game-improvement model. Touted as Ping’s “longest iron ever,” the multi-material club offers a lower center of gravity with stronger, custom-engineered lofts and a thinner face. The trio of improvements leads to an additional 2 mph ball speed across the entire face. Ping focused on improving several areas with i230, beginning with the overall look. While the compact mid and short irons are a carryover from the i210 design, special emphasis was placed on reducing the overall footprint of the long irons by shortening the blade length for a more compact look at address. A more rounded leading edge and additional bounce were also added to each sole to promote consistent turf interaction through impact. Models include Ping G430 and Ping i230.

Click through to purchase your new PXG 0311 irons today.

        BUY NOW      



The new 0311 Gen5 irons have a new lighter core material called XCOR2 and a power channel behind the face — two things PXG carefully developed to make the Gen5 lighter and faster for a greater energy transfer into the ball at impact. There are three models to choose from in the Gen5 line: 0311 T — a Tour-inspired headshape for better players who want added workability in a forgiving iron. The next is the 0311 P, a goldilocks model combining added forgiveness, workability and more distance. The last is the 0311 XP, with a larger headshape with more offset for added distance and forgiveness. Models include PXG 0311 T, PXG 0311 P and PXG 0311 XP.

Click through to purchase your new Srixon irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



Thanks to innovations like Srixon’s PureFrame, it’s now possible to get a solid feel on off-center strikes. The frame is a key piece of technology for the new ZX MKII iron line, which consists of three models — the ZX4, ZX5 and ZX7. Forged into the body of the iron directly behind the sweet spot is a raised piece of 1020 carbon steel that’s 80 percent thicker. The traditional blade in the lineup, Z-Forged II (3-PW) has “mid-height toe and heel” features on the back of the club. The compact profile and reduced offset make it easy to work the ball on command. Just don’t expect much in the way of forgiveness. Models include Srixon ZX4, Srixon ZX5, Srixon ZX7 and Srixon Z-Forged II.

TaylorMade P770, P7MB, P7MC and Stealth HD Irons

                $1000-1500            
Click through to purchase your new TaylorMade irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



There is no “secret sauce” in the TaylorMade P7MC and MB. Unlike their siblings in the P7-Series — the new P770 and extremely popular P790, which are thin-faced forged hollow body designs — the P7MC and MB aren’t built with flashy new technology. Instead, the innovation in the 1025 carbon steel heads comes from its manufacturing process. In order to build the P7MC and MB, engineers utilize a 5-step forging process, with a final 2000-ton press helping to produce a tight and compact grain structure in order to offer the most consistent and solid feel possible. The Stealth HD iron is a completely new design intended to increase the likelihood of what TaylorMade calls a successful shot out on the course. The premise for the design came from a change in the testing process for the iron design team with a focus on what success means to golfers in the game-improvement category. Models include TaylorMade P770, TaylorMade P7MC, TaylorMade P7MB and TaylorMade Stealth HD.

Click through to purchase your new Wilson Dynapower irons at Fairway Jockey today.

        BUY NOW      



The all-new 2023 Dynapower irons build on the original weighting-shifting concept to redefine distance by pulling mass away from the heel side of the club toward the toe where most amateurs tend to miss with their irons. By using an exclusive A.I. modeling platform, Wilson engineers went through thousands of variations of variable face thickness designs for the cavity of the iron to optimize the iron faces through the set and offer optimal performance in every club.
