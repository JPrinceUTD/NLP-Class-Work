The 2023 Genesis Invitational begins Thursday, February 16, in Los Angeles.

The 2023 Genesis Invitational kicks off this week at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles, where tournament host Tiger Woods will make his return to the PGA Tour. Here’s everything you need to know to watch the tournament.
Genesis Invitational preview
As with last week’s WM Phoenix Open, the Genesis Invitational is one of the PGA Tour’s new “designated events.” That means all of the biggest PGA Tour pros will be playing this week, and they’ll be competing for an enormous prize pool of $20 million on a historic golf course.





If that’s not enough to get you excited about this week’s event, the long-awaited return of Tiger Woods should do the trick. Woods, who is the tournament host, announced last week that he would be teeing it up in the tournament to go along with his hosting duties. This marks the first time since last July’s Open Championship that Woods has competed in an official event.
It’s hard to predict how Tiger will fare after so much time away, but you can count on stellar performances from the current best players in the world, including new World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and more.
Golf Channel and CBS will provide TV coverage of the Genesis Invitational, and PGA Tour Live on ESPN+ and Peacock will stream the action online, with ESPN+ providing exclusive early coverage of all four rounds.

  All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team.
