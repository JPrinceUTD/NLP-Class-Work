Kanga coolers are perfect for the golf course.

Welcome to Gimme That, a GOLF.com column where we’ll highlight one notable item we think you might like. Whether it’s an article of clothing, an intriguing electronic device or anything in between, we want to share these items with you because they’ve generated a bit of chatter by our water cooler (or, these days, on our Slack channel). So sit back, scroll down and keep up with the latest gear golf has to offer.
Whether you’re rolling up to the course with a six-pack or a 30-rack, you should have a Kanga cooler. These cases go right over the box and double as a way to keep your beers both cold and incognito. 
Their super-lightweight exterior is guaranteed to keep your beverages of choice cold without ice (yes, without ice) for up to seven hours, making this the ideal accessory for golf, tailgating, boating and beaching. Plus, they look pretty sleek. Don’t lug around a heavy, odd-sized cooler again. With Kanga, simply slide the box into the case and you’re ready to rock. 
Use the buttons below to explore the different size options today.

  All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team.
