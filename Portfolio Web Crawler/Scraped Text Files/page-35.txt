Tiger Woods is in line to make the cut in his first PGA Tour event of the year.

Tiger Woods‘ comeback week at the 2023 Genesis Invitational continues on Saturday with the third round at Riviera. Here’s what you need to know to watch Tiger’s third round, including complete streaming and TV schedules. (NOTE: Tee times for Round 3 will be determined Saturday morning after the completion of Round 2.)
When Tiger Woods tees off Saturday
Tiger Woods made three late bogeys to shoot a 74 in the second round of the Genesis Invitational, dropping him to one over for the tournament and temporarily putting him at risk of missing the cut. 
But after most of the afternoon wave had finished their rounds on Friday, the cutline had moved, and Woods was in line to earn tee times on the weekend.





Unfortunately, we don’t know what Tiger’s third-round tee time is yet. Round 2 was suspended Friday night due to darkness, and complete third-round tee times can’t be determined until all players have finished their second rounds.
So those players still on the course will return early Saturday morning to finish out. Once they do, Round 3 tee times will be created and released. Woods’ will likely end up starting his round between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on Saturday.
How to watch Tiger Woods on Saturday
Extensive streaming coverage of the third round of the Genesis Invitational will be provided by PGA Tour Live on ESPN+ beginning at 12 p.m. ET on Saturday, with featured group coverage running all day long. Tiger will be among the featured groups, which means you’ll be able to watch every single shot he hits on Saturday via ESPN+.
Golf Channel and CBS will carry the round on TV, with Golf Channel kicking off the action at 1 p.m. ET.
