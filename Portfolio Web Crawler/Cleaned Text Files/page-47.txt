In a field of 129, the World No.
2 ranked just 39th in strokes gained: off the tee.
Not bad, but certainly not at the level that got McIlroy to 3rd on Tour in that same category last season.
And in his post-round presser, it was clear he knew it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go work on the range,‚Äù he told reporters.
‚ÄúI put my driver up a click in loft at the start of the week, I might have to turn it back down again.
I don‚Äôt like [Tiger] hitting it byme.‚Äù On Friday, McIlroy returned to Riviera with change on his mind ‚Äî and much more than a ‚Äúclick in loft.‚Äù When Rory arrived at the course on Friday, he‚Äôd changed up his driver from the first-generation Stealth Plus to a second-generation Stealth 2 Plus.
The move was, to put it lightly, a surprise.
Although Rory made changes to his wedge setup prior to the start of his 2023 season, his first-gen Stealth Plus driver has been a mainstay in the bag going back to the start of the 2022 season.
Rory McIlroy at the 2022 Open Championship Getty Images     The driver change is looking like a good one for Rory, who jumped from 39th in the field in SG: off-the-tee on Thursday to 3rd on Friday.
The highlight reel certainly enjoyed the change, too.
Even though it represents a statistical outlier, Rory recorded the longest drive of the tournament with the new driver in his bag, a whopping 388-yard blast that measured some 50 yards longer than his longest drive of round of 1.
