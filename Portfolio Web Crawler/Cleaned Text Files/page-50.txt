Precision Putting Laser $39.99  Precision Putting Laser  Think of yourself as a Sniper, and your putter is the  badass modified rifle that helps you lock on to your target.
Our Precision Putting Laser goes on top of your weapon (the putter) and shows you EXACTLY how to perfect your aim, so you can feel more confident pulling that trigger.
As we already know, 97% of players suck at aiming (see: Accurate Aim Kit) and if your aim is poor, you’ll have to make adjustments throughout the stroke to get the putter face aimed down the correct line in time for impact.
This leads to inconsistencies and missed putts.
The PPL comes with a tripod as well, which allows you to create a sort of “chalk line”- but this chalk line won’t ruin your hardwood floors.
Click the Laser onto the tripod, align it with your target, and you have a clear visual of the line you’re trying to hit.
*This laser is designed for indoor use, and is not visible in bright outdoor light*          Buy Now       View Product                All Terrain Putting Gate $19.99 All Terrain Putting Gate  No more excuses- our All Terrain Putting Gates are built for indoor AND outdoor practice… which means rain or shine, you can get to work on your putting.
The All Terrain Gate comes with detachable feet, so that you can place them on whatever flat surface your heart desires.
If you’re outdoors, just pop the feet off and secure the Gate into the putting green.
The included string will also help you measure 14 inches from the gate.
From here, you must be within 1° of accuracy to roll it through the Gate- which means you can measure your performance over time in a tangible way.
Count how many out of 10 you can roll through the gate, and keep track to watch your skills improve.
Of the Pros we tested, all averaged 8 out of 10.
Good luck!
