Fujikura Golf   After taking the golf shaft world by storm with the original Ventus, it didn’t take long for golfers to ask if Fujikura’s Velocore technology would make its way into a graphite iron shaft.
Now, after years of development — including the invention of a multi-length fitting system — the Axiom iron shaft has arrived.
The new Axiom graphite iron shafts were developed and validated using high-speed ENSO analytics, allowing engineers the ability to precisely monitor the shaft during the golf swing.
This gave Fujikura the ability to configure the materials and profile to build a comprehensive line of shafts, developing a system for golfers to find the perfect fit.
The Fujikura Axiom graphite shaft.
Fujikura golf     “When we set out to create an iron shaft that would feature our flagship technology, it needed to meet very demanding and specific criteria for us to call it a success,” said Spencer Reynolds, Fujikura’s Product & Brand Manager.
“Not only did it need to provide golfers the same exceptional benefits they’ve experienced with other Velocore-powered products, it also needed to give players the unique and iron-specific performance attributes that will truly enhance their critical scoring shots.” The key technology in the Axiom is a three-length system that creates specific weight and flex-matching for long, mid and short irons, allowing club builders to tune shafts for an exact fit through the set for any golfer.
Beyond its building and fitting benefits, the Velocore-powered iron shafts demonstrated increased ball speeds thanks to the tip stabilization, which also resulted in tighter dispersion and ball flight windows.
Pricing, options, and availability Axiom iron shafts will be available through Fujikura’s Charter Dealer network beginning March 2023 and will come in three distinct weight categories: 125-gram (x-stiff) priced at $125, 105-gram (stiff, & x-stiff) priced at $115, and 75-gram (R2-soft regular, regular, & stiff) priced at $105 Want to overhaul your bag for 2023?
