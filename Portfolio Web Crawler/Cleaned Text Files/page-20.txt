Getty Images   Visitors to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area of Arizona are experiencing a double-whammy of premium prices this week.
Not only is the annual WM Phoenix Open this week, but also the Super Bowl, which is being hosted by State Farm Stadium in nearby Glendale.
The area has been abuzz with events and activities, with local establishments doing their best to capitalize on the influx of out-of-towners.
