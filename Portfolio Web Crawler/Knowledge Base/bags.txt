on Friday on the 17th hole at Riviera Country Club.', '(We googled ‘lucky breaks golf Robert Rock.’) On it, somebody did pull-hook a tee shot on a par-3, the ball did hit a tree and it did go in the hole — the somebody was James Kingston, at the 2002 Alfred Dunhill Championship, and it was ‘lucky break’ No.', '“I mean, there was a lot of great golf today, but one of the greatest breaks I’ve seen.', 'When someone says, that’s golf, this is what they also speak of.', '“Obviously I got very fortunate to get that bounce not only to go on the green, but to have basically three feet straight up the hill, that’s arguably the best bounce I’ve seen in person my whole golf career and it would be hard to beat in the future,” said Rahm, who bogeyed 18 and will start Saturday one shot back of leader Max Homa.', '“There’s almost a little hint of embarrassment because come on, that is very, very lucky, but I feel like as golfers, we get plenty of bad breaks in our lifetime.', 'In his role, he is responsible for editing, writing and developing stories across the golf space.', 'And when he’s not writing about ways to hit the golf ball farther and straighter, the Milwaukee native is probably playing the game, hitting the ball left, right and short, and drinking a cold beer to wash away his score.', 'You can reach out to him about any of these topics — his stories, his game or his
